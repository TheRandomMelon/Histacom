(Note: Readme is a WIP.)
Histacom is a C# (SDL2) version of the PC game Histacom, released by 12padams in 2010. Here are some of our goals:
* Get Histacom's SDL2 rewrite to the same playable state that the original Histacom's in and beyond.
* Add more applications to the operating systems.
* Add more story elements.

## Building
Histacom is currently being developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. If you are using a different IDE, please do so with caution. We cannot guarantee the stability of other IDEs.

Load the ``.sln`` project file into Visual Studio and compile. No further steps are required. This list may grow in the future.
